# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification

In this project we classify whether images, in the given dataset, contain either a dog or a cat

## Usage

- Run the desired Jupyter notebook or the Python script in the Code folder

  ```
  python3 model_no_gpu.py
  ```
- Both the notebooks as well as the report contain the dataset and the directory structure looks like as follows :

        dogs-vs-cats
          test
            test
                <contains all the training images (25000 images)>
          train
            train
                <contains all the testing images (12500 images)>
