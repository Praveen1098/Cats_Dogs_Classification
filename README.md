# Cats vs Dogs Image Classification

In this project we classify whether images, in the given dataset, contain either a dog or a cat

- Run the desired Jupyter notebook in the Code folder
- Both the notebooks have information for dataset extraction and directory structure looks like as follows :

        dogs-vs-cats
          test
            test
                <contains all the training images (25000 images)>
          train
            train
                <contains all the testing images (12500 images)>	

## Dependencies:
